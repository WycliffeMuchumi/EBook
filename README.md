# EBook
EBook an online book store, is a REST API that performs all the CRUD operations such as creating a book,reading all books,updating a book and deleting a book as well(i.e CRUD(Create,Read,Update and Delete).The web framework used is Flask and other underlying library technologies such as flask-marshmallow for serialization of objects,flask-sqlalchemy which is the preferred Object Relational Mapper to facilitate interactions with a postgreSQL database,and finally marshmallow-sqlalchemy for marshmallow and sqlalchemy integrations).The data is fetched through POSTMAN in json format.POSTMAN is also very handful in testing of the REST API CRUD operations.
